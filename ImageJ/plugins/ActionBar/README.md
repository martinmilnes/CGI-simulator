The ActionBar plugin is an (optional) plugin used by the CGI trajectory simulation software.

Alternatively, the CGI software cn be called directly from the ImageJ main menu (under "Plugins/MultiLevel Vectors Atlantic"),
but only after a suitable background map has been loaded (eg Config/LatLonNewNA.png).
